# Nature - your adventure starts here üíö

A project for school, where we were suppose to make a fictional webshop with the theme - Nature.

As a guest you can browse products, see a more detailed popup about the product, when clicking on a product.

As a customer you can login and add products to your cart, change the amount of products in cart, remove products from the cart and make a purchase.

As an logged in admin for the webshop, you can update already existing products, add new products and delete products.
